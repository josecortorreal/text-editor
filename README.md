## Description
The Simple Text Editor Web Application allows you to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection. It utilizes IndexedDB to store your content locally, making it reliably retrievable for later use, even without an active internet connection.

## Features
- Create and edit notes or code snippets in a user-friendly text editor.
- Automatically saves your content to IndexedDB when you click off the DOM window, ensuring data persistence.
- Retrieve and load your previously saved content from IndexedDB when you reopen the application.


## How to Use
1. After starting the application, open your web browser and go to the provided URL (usually http://localhost:your_port).
2. You'll see a client-server folder structure in the browser.
3. The application should be bundled using Webpack, and you'll find generated HTML, service worker, and manifest files.
4. Create new text notes or code snippets in the text editor.
5. Click off the DOM window to automatically save your content to IndexedDB.
6. Close and reopen the application to see your saved content retrieved from IndexedDB.
