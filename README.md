## Description
The Simple Text Editor Web Application allows you to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection. It utilizes IndexedDB to store your content locally, making it reliably retrievable for later use, even without an active internet connection.

## Features
- Create and edit notes or code snippets in a user-friendly text editor.
- Automatically saves your content to IndexedDB when you click off the DOM window, ensuring data persistence.
- Retrieve and load your previously saved content from IndexedDB when you reopen the application.
